## FAQs
Some of the frequently asked questions from users -
1. My pull request has been merged but it isn't showing up on the wiki page. Why?

   Once a pull request is merged successfully, the changes can be seen in [Nightly Wiki](https://nilpointer-software.github.io/bdfd-wiki/nightly) after 2-3 minutes. In the case of [Main Wiki](https://nilpointer-software.github.io/bdfd-wiki), it will take some weeks since the contributed markdown files are deployed by a Developer only.

2. Do i get any perks for contributing?

   Although, you may not be credited for making of the wiki. However, if applicable the Developers reserve the right to give perks/accreditation to users for contributing.
