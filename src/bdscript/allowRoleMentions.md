# $allowRoleMentions
Disables the pings for the roles not provided, which means the role will be 'fake pinged' *(the role will be pinged, but users will not get notified of the ping)*. While, the inputted allowed roles are ones that can be pinged *(and it will work like a regular ping)*.

## Usage
```
$allowRoleMentions[roleIDs]
```

### Breakdown
- `roleIDs` - The roles that can be pinged, leave empty to disable pings for every role. Separate role IDs using `;`.

## Example
```
$nomention
$allowRoleMentions[]
I'm pinging <@&858376972303204362>, but no one got notified; wow!
```
