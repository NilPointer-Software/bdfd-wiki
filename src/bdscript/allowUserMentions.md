# $allowUserMentions
Disables the pings for the users not provided, which means the user will be 'fake pinged' *(the user will be pinged, but will not get notified of the ping)*. While the inputted allowed users can be pinged *(and it will work like a regular notification-ping)*.

## Usage
```php
$allowUserMentions[userIDs;...]
```

| Argument | Description | Type | Flags |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

## Example
```
$nomention
$allowUserMentions[]
Hi <@$authorID>! I mentioned you, but you didn't get notified.
