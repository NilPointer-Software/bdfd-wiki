# $checkCondition
Checks if a condition is `true` or `false`.

## Usage
```
$checkCondition[condition]
```

## Explanation
Simply put, `$checkCondition` serves as a way to make a custom true or false statement. For example: `$checkCondition[$username==Spen]`, the bot would return "true" if someone named Spen used the command, otherwise it would return "false". However this: `$checkCondition[$username!=Spen]`, would return "false" if someone named Spen used the command, otherwise it would return "true".

Base Usage: `$checkCondition[value1(sign)value2]`

**What's Sign?**
Replace (sign) with one of these.

- `==` - Should be equal 
- `!=` - Should be not equal 
- `<`- Should be less than (only numbers) 
- `>`- Should be greater than (only numbers) 
- `>=` - Should be greater than or equal to (only numbers) 
- `<=` - Should be less than or equal to (only numbers) 

**What Are Values?**

The value is what the bot is checking. Like one of the examples above: `$checkCondition[$username==Spen]`.
- value1 is $username
- sign is ==
- value2 is Spen
