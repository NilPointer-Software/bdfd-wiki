# $addField
Adds a field to an embed.

## Usage
```
$addField[name;value;(inline;index)]
```
> üìù You can create upto a maximum of 25 fields per embed.

### Breakdown
- `name` - The name of the field. It cannot exceed more than 256 characters.
- `value` - The value of the field. It cannot exceed more than 1024 characters.
- `inline` - If 'yes', fields will appear in same line. However, if you have more than 3 fields (or the fields are just too long) with inline enabled, the bot will return rows with 3 fields (2 if there is a thumbnail) in each row. 'no' by default. (Optional)
- `index` - Adds field to specified embed index number (Optional). Default is `1`. [(learn more)](/src/resources/embedIndexes.md)
