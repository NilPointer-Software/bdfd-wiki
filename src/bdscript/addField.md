# $addField
Adds a field to an embed.

## Usage
```
$addField[name;value;(inline?;index)]
```
> You can create up to a maximum of 25 fields per embed.

### Parameters
- `name`: The name of the field. It cannot exceed more than 256 characters.
- `value`: The value of the field. It cannot exceed more than 1024 characters.
- `inline?`: If `yes`, fields will appear in the same line. However, if you have more than 3 fields (or the fields are just too long) with inline enabled, the bot will return rows with 3 fields (2 if there is a thumbnail) in each row. It is set to `no` by default. (Optional)
