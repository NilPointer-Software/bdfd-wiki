# $isUserDMEnabled
Checks whether or not the bot can DM (direct message) the user. 'true' means the bot can DM the user, 'false' means it can't.

> üóíÔ∏è **Note:** This function checks if a user has their DMs enabled by trying to send an empty message to the user, there is no official feature in Discord's API to check if a user is direct message-able. Therefore, this function isn't perfect but for the most part; it will give the correct output.

If a user is not direct message-able, it means one or more of the following:
- they have their DMs disabled in the server(s) that they share with the bot.
- they have their DMs disabled to non-friends (bots can't send friend requests).
- they don't share any servers with the bot.
- they blocked the bot.
