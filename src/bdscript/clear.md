# $clear
Deletes a certain amount of messages.

## Usages
There are two usages of the `$clear` function.

### Usage #1
```
$clear
```
> 📝 When using just `$clear`, the author's message must include a number.

### Usage #2
```
$clear[howMany;(optional) userID;(optional) removePinnedMessages (yes/no)]
```

#### Breakdown
- `howMany` - How many messages to delete. (max 100)
- `userID` - If a userID is provided, the bot will only delete messages from that user. Optional.
- `removePinnedMessages` - Decides whether to delete pinned messages or not. Default is 'yes'. Optional.

> 📝 Discord doesn't allow deleting messages in bulk which are over 2 weeks old.

## Example
```
$nomention
$onlyPerms[managemessages;You need the 'MANAGE_MESSAGES' permission to use that!]
$argsCheck[>1;Please provide how many messages to clear. Usage: !purge (number)]
$clear[$message]
```
