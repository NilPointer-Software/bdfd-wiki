# Sharding
As we understand that scalability is a vital feature when making Discord bots, we are excited to announce that as of December 9th 2021, we have added support for **sharding**! âœ¨\
This means that bots made in *Bot Designer for Discord* will be able to be in multiple thousand servers without experiencing any issues.

### FAQs
#### What Is Sharding?
Sharding is the method by which a bot's code is "split" into multiple instances of itself. When a bot is sharded, each shard handles only a certain percentage of all the servers the bot is in.

#### When Is Sharding Needed?
Sharding is needed once your bot gets in approximately 2,500 servers.

#### How Do I Enable Sharding
We handle it all automatically! You don't have to worry about toggling anything.

#### Who Has Access To Sharding?
For now, sharding is only available to premium users. However, we have plans in the future when sharding is more stable, to release it to everyone.
