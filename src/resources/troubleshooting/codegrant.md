If you get an error like the image above when trying to invite your bot, it means you enabled the `Requires OAUTH2 Code Grant` setting.\
Don't worry! You can disable it by following these steps:

**#1:** Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select your bot.

**#2:** Select the "Bot" tab.\

**#3:** Right under the `Public Bot` setting, you'll the the `Requires OAUTH2 Code Grant`, make sure it's disabled.\

> If you followed these steps, the code grant error should go away, and you should be able to invite your bot normally.
