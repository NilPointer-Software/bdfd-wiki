# Role Hierarchy
Role Hierarchy, or Role Placement, refers to the place where a role is located on the role list. If a role is at the top of the role's list then it's the highest role on the hierarchy. If a role is at the bottom of the role's list, then it's the lowest role on the hierarchy.

Hierarchy is important because your bot won't be able to perform some actions on users that have role(s) that are higher than the bot's highest role.

A quick fix to avoid any of these issues is just putting the bot's role near the top of the role hierarchy. You should not put the bot at the top of the hierarchy, but right below the "Moderator" role is a good spot.
