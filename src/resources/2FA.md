# 2FA and Elevated Permissions
If a guild owner enables the server's *"Two-factor authentication for moderation"* setting, everyone executing a certain segment of actions will need to have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled on their account. Since, bots do not have 2FA themselves, you as the bot owner, will need to enable it on your account.

The permissions assigned to these actions are referred to as *"Elevated permissions"*. Elevated permissions include but may not limited to :

- `admin`
- `ban`
- `kick`
- `managechannels`
- `manageemojis`
- `managemessages`
- `manageroles`
- `manageserver`
- `managethreads`
- `managewebhooks`

> 📝 More info about enabling 2FA can be found in [Discord's support article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication).
