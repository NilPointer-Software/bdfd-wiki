# Beginning
In this guide you will learn how to create your own bot with BDFD.

## Step 1 - Creating
- Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Click on the *"New Application"* button and provide a name for your application.
- In top-left corner, click on the hamburger icon (`â‰¡`) and select the *"Bots"* tab.
- Then, press the *"Add Bot"* button to create a discord bot.
- Once done, press the *"Reset Token"* button and copy your bot token.
> Never share your Discord bot token with anyone. *[Learn more](../../resources/security.md#sharing-tokens)*
- Now, open your BDFD app *(If you haven't installed the app yet, head over to [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jakubtomana.discordbotdesinger)/[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/bot-designer-for-discord/id1495536477) and download it)* and press *"Create New Bot"*.
> Make sure that when you are creating a new bot, your Discord account is signed into the BDFD app. This is so that you don't lose access to your bot in the future.
- Enter your bot's name and its token *(the one that you copied earlier from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))*.
- If you have a [share code](../other/sharecode.md), toggle on *"Use share code"* and put the code into the text field.
- After agreeing to the Terms of Service of both [BDFD](../terms.md) & [Discord](https://discord.com/terms), press "Create bot" to create your Discord bot.

## Step 2 - Inviting
- Open the BDFD app and select your bot.
- Click on the *"Invite bot to server"* button.
- Press the *"Edit invite link permissions"* button and choose the permissions that the bot will have when joined the server.
- Then, click on the *"Add your bot to your server"* and selected the server.
- Click on the *"Continue"* button and your bot will be added to the server.

## Step 3 - First Code
To create the first command, you must click on *"Commands"* in the selected bot and press on the *"+ Command creator"*.
You will see 3 categories ("Command Name", "Command Trigger", "Template Functions").
- Come up with a name for your command and paste it into the "Team Name" field. (You can leave it blank).
- Now come up with a trigger for the command. (Example: `!ping`).
> It is important that the trigger of the command matches its meaning.
After completing the command setup, press the *"Create Command"* button. Now you can create your first code!
In "Reply Message" you can paste this code:
```
$nomention
$reply
Pong!
```
- Click on *"Save command"* to save the code.

## Step 4 - Bot Online
### Method 1 - 30 Minutes
- Click on *"Dashboard"* in the selected bot and press on the *"+ Add free hosting time"* button.
- Enter the indicated numbers and click *"Confirm"*.
### Method 2 - 140 Minutes
- Click on *"Dashboard"* in the selected bot and press on the *"+ Add free hosting time"* button.
- ### Method 3 - Premium
You can host your Discord bot in the app by either watching free ads or purchasing [premium](../../premium/introduction.md).
