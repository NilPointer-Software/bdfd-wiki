# Beginning
In this guide, you will learn how to create a Discord bot in BDFD.

### Creating a Bot
- Go to [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Click on the *"New Application"* button and provide a name for your application.
- In top-left corner, click on the hamburger icon (`‚â°`) and select the *"Bots"* tab.
- Then, press the *"Add Bot"* button to create a discord bot.
- Once done, press the *"Reset Token"* button and copy your bot token.

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è Never share your Discord bot token with anyone. *[Learn more](../resources/security.md#sharing-tokens)*
- Now, open your BDFD app *(If you haven't installed the app yet, head over to [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jakubtomana.discordbotdesinger)/[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/bot-designer-for-discord/id1495536477) and download it)* and press *"Create New Bot"*.
   > üìù Make sure that when you are creating a new bot, your Discord account is signed into the BDFD app. This is so that you don't lose access to your bot in the future.
- Enter your bot's name and its token *(the one that you copied earlier from the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))*.
- If you have a [share code](../other/sharecode.md), toggle on *"Use share code"* and put the code into the text field.
- After agreeing to the terms of service of both [BDFD](https://botdesignerdiscord.com/tos) & [Discord](https://discord.com/terms), press "Create bot" to create your Discord bot.

### Inviting the bot
To add the bot into a server, [see this guide](./general/interactions/slashCommands/aboutSlashCommands.md#inviting-the-bot).

### Hosting the bot
You can host your Discord bot in the app by either watching free ads or purchasing [premium](../premium/introduction.md).
