# Hyperlinks
A hyperlink is clickable-text. When the user clicks on the text, it directs them to a certain URL.

## General Hyperlinks
You can use hyperlinks inside [`$description[]`](../bdscript/description.md), [`$addField[]`](../bdscript/addField.md), [webhook](../guides/webhooks.md) content/description, [slash command](../guides/slashCommands.md) response content, and ephemeral [`$onInteraction`](../callbacks/onInteraction.md) response content.

### Syntax
```
[text\](link)
```
> **Note:** This is the syntax for BDScript 2 and BDScript Unstable. For the BDScript, the syntax is `[text](link)`.

> **Note:** In the case of using hyperlinks inside slash command response content or ephemeral `$onInteraction` response content, the syntax for BDScript should be used. Does not apply to hyperlinks that are inside functions that support hyperlinks.
