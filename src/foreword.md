That makes building Discord bots easy with beginner-friendly functions. An app that's capable of developing nearly all types of bots - from simple *echo* bots, to advanced multi-purpose administration ones. Where simplicity meets functionality and scalability. 

That's [**Bot Designer for Discord**](https://botdesignerdiscord.com).

### How does it work?
It's very simple! All functions start with `$`, so you'll never get confused with `"` or `()`. Don't forget to close `[]` for functions that need it.

### Simple code
```
$nomention
Message: $messageID
```
